        "output": "The evaluation of physical properties, usually including pressure, temperature and wellbore trajectory in three-dimensional space, while extending a wellbore. MWD is now standard practice in offshore directional wells, where the tool cost is offset by rig time and wellbore stability considerations if other tools are used. The measurements are made downhole, stored in solid-state memory for some time and later transmitted to the surface. Data transmission methods vary from company to company, but usually involve digitally encoding data and transmitting to the surface as pressure pulses in the mud system. These pressures may be positive, negative or continuous sine waves. Some MWD tools have the ability to store the measurements for later retrieval with wireline or when the tool is tripped out of the hole if the data transmission link fails. MWD tools that measure formation parameters (resistivity, porosity, sonic velocity, gamma ray) are referred to as logging-while-drilling (LWD) tools. LWD tools use similar data storage and transmission systems, with some having more solid-state memory to provide higher resolution logs after the tool is tripped out than is possible with the relatively low bandwidth, mud-pulse data transmission system.

In undersaturated soil, deionized water is added to a soil sample with minimal mixing until all soil pores are filled with water and there is negligible air in the pores. Mixing is minimized to retain natural pore size distribution as much as possible and to minimize expansion of expandable clay minerals such as smectite and vermiculite. The percent of soil-pore water weight to dry soil weight at this precise moisture content is called the saturation percentage, and this is unique for each different soil due to different types, sizes, and shapes of solid constituents. The saturated paste moisture content is useful as a reference because it represents the actual concentrations and ratios of dissolved constituents which are available for uptake by plant roots."

Specific conductance is related to the type and concentration of ions in solution and can be used to approximate the dissolved-solids concentration in water. Estimates of the dissolved-solids concentration (in mg/L) range from 60% to 85% of the specific-conductance value in 1-JS/cm at 25°C. For sulfate­type waters, the estimated range of dissolved solids concentration in mg/L is from 90% to 100% of the specific-conductance value."

At high pH they have a negative charge and a cation exchange capacity. At low pH they have a positive charge and an an ion exchange capacity. In most soils, iron oxides help to stabilize soil aggregates. Red soils are indicative of a high degree of oxidation. Yellow soils are also oxidized but less intensively than red soils. Red and yellow mottles (spots) in a soil are often indicative of a fluctuating water table. In water logged soils the iron in goethite and hematite has become soluble and leached out of the soil leaving a chalky gray color. If these soils are drained, any remaining iron rapidly oxidizes and forms oxides exhibited by new yellow or red coloring."

The fluid enters the formation and parts or fractures it. Sand grains, aluminum pellets, glass beads, or similar materials are carried in suspension by the fluid into the fractures. These are called propping agents or proppants. When the pressure is released at the surface, the fracturing fluid returns to the well, and the fractures partially close on the proppants, leaving channels for oil to flow through them to the well. This process is often called a frac job."

This carrier wave is modulated by group waves that propagate at group speeds. In a nondispersing wave, the group speeds are the same as the phase velocity of the wave components. In a dispersing wave, however, these group speeds can be different. If the group speeds are greater than the phase velocities, it will appear that a carrier wave originates at the back of the wave, propagates forward until it reaches the front of the wave, vanishes, and reappears at the back of the wave. If the group speeds are less than the phase velocities, it will appear that a carrier wave originates at the front of  the wave, propagates backward until it reaches the back of the wave, vanishes, and reappears at the front of the wave. This can be visualized by thinking of a caterpillar’s motion. The caterpillar’s ripples appear to move backward, yet the caterpillar moves forward. This is one reason the analysis of dispersing waves can be very complicated."

        "output": "The pH of a soil solution is a measure of the active acidity [concentration of dissolved free hydrogen ions (H+)] in the soil solution. A low pH indicates an excess of hydro gen ions compared to hydroxyl ions (OH-). The lower the pH the greater the acidity in the soil, and the scale is logarithmic. In very acid soils (pH < 5), trivalent aluminum (AI+3) which is a component of numerous clay minerals becomes increasingly soluble. When dissolved, each aluminum ion is strong enough to split three water molecules (by three stages of hydrolysis) in order to bond with the three hydroxyl ions thus released. This releases three hydrogen ions to the soil solution, and further increases the acidity. When chemical amendments are added to neutralize an acid soil, the amount of chemical amendment applied (lime) must be sufficient to neutralize both the free hydrogen ions (H+) and the three species of free aluminum ions [AI+3, AI(OH)+2, and AI(OH)2+1] which are still capable of causing further hydrolysis and acidification. Because of the complex reactions involved, the amount of lime required to balance the pH is determined by titrating a known mass of soil with a base representing lime. When the titration stabilizes at an appropriate endpoint (e.g., pH = 7.0), the amount of base used correlates with the amount of lime which must be added to neutralize the hydrogen ions and aluminum ions. Reserve acidity is the combined acid potential of H+, Al+3, AI (OH)+2, and AI (OH)2+1 ions adsorbed on clay colloids, whereas active acidity is free H+ in the soil solution (not adsorbed)."

In general, probable reserves may include (1) reserves anticipated to be proved by normal step-out drilling where sub-surface control is inadequate to classify these reserves as proved, (2) reserves in formations that appear to be productive, based on well log characteristics, but lack core data or definitive tests and which are not analogous to producing or proved reservoirs in the area, (3) incremental reserves attributable to infill drilling that could have been classified as proved if closer statutory spacing had been approved at the time of the estimate, (4) reserves attributable to improved recovery methods that have been established by repeated commercially successful applications when (a) a project or pilot is planned, but not in operation and (b) rock, fluid, and reservoir characteristics appear favorable for commercial application, (5) reserves in an area of the formation that appears to be separated from the proved area by faulting and the geologic interpretation indicates the subject area is structurally higher than the proved area, (6) reserves attributable to a future workover, treatment, re-treatment, change of equipment, or other mechanical procedures, where such procedure has not been proved successful in wells which exhibit similar behavior in analogous reservoirs, and (7) incremental reserves in proved reservoirs where an alternative interpretation of performance or volumetric data indicates more reserves than can be classified as proved.

In this context, when probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of estimated proved, plus probable, plus possible reserves.  In general, possible reserves may include (1) reserves which, based on geological interpretations, could possibly exist beyond areas classified as probable, (2) reserves in formations that appear to be petroleum bearing, based on log and core analysis but may not be productive at commercial rates, (3) incremental reserves attributed to infill drilling that are subject to technical uncertainty, (4) reserves attributed to improved recovery methods when (a) a project or pilot is planned, but not in operation and (b) rock, fluid, and reservoir characteristics are such that a reasonable doubt exists that the project will be commercial, and (5) reserves in an area of the formation that appears to be separated from the proved area by faulting and geological interpretation indicates the subject area is structurally lower than the proved area. Often referred to as P3 (SPE)."

Exchangeable acidity is therefore the number of meq/100 grams of soil which consist of hydrogen, aluminum, and aluminum mono and di-hydroxide ions.
